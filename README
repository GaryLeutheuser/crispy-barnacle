This project consists of the source code for the various sensors used in the
MHMS senior design project. The project currently consists of the following
sensors, each requiring a unique source code file. A listing of these sensors
along with their current work status are shown below:

    1. Humidity
	Complete
    2. Smoke
	Complete
    3. Carbon Monoxide
	Complete
    4. Passive Infrared (PIR)
	Complete

These files are intended (via Arduino), to be loaded onto the RFduino device.
Note also that additional functionality is defined in the RFduinoCustoms library,
which should be symlinked to in each sensor directory in order to satisfy Arduino
file location requirements.
