This project consists of the source code for the various sensors used in the
MHMS senior design project. The project currently consists of the following
sensors, each requiring a unique source code file:

    1. Humidity
    2. Smoke
    3. Carbon Monoxide
    4. Passive Infrared (PIR)

These files are intended (via Arduino), to be loaded onto the RFduino device.
